# Algorithms and Data Structures Laboratory
A set of highly reliable libraries and some C++ theory.

## Libraries
In the 'librerie' folder you can find the following libraries written in C++:
* Library 1: Vector and List
* Library 2: Stack and Queue (both vector and list representation)
* Library 3: Binary tree (both vector and linked nodes representation)
* Library 4: Binary Search Tree (linked nodes representation only)
* Library 5: Matrix (both vector and Compressed Sparse Row/Yale representation)

You can test them either by using a menu or by running a simple stress test. The Professor intensively stress tested them with his complete stress test resulting in 0 errors.
